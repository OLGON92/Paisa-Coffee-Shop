## üåê About the Project

### üìñ Description
_This is a Coffee Shop Inventory Manager. It has full CRUD capability, meaning that you can look at a list of coffee sacks, look for a specific coffee sack, add acoffee sack, edit acoffee sack, and delete acoffee sack. Each coffee sack profile includes a name, roast, origin, price, and the amount of beans in pounds. This is my first React project for Epicodus. Here is a [link](https://github.com/OLGON92/Paisa-Coffee-Shop) to the repository. *Also, please note that the term "paisa" in this case refers to the coffee growing region in Colombia.*_
### ü¶† Known Bugs
